stateful push service module
===================

The stateful push service module is made to abstract away from constructing
the payloads required by the push get data function, but also to
handle the bufferes required for push notifications.

To use this module, add ${unabto_module_stateful_push_service_src} to your project CMakeLists.txt sources.
